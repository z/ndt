Version: 0.6 Beta
Released: 05/26/2009
Created By: Tyler "-z-" Mulligan of the Nexuiz Ninjaz (www.nexuizninjaz.com)

Required Software: subversion (svn)
Optional Software: 7zip (in a future release)

Description:
This script was created to help linux users create a local development
environment easily.  Making up for the downfalls of other build
scripts, NDT allows you to compile each part of the build process 
(engine, compiler and game) and modify their revisions seperately.

By default the script exports a vanilla copy for testing of trunk
and a development version you can hack around in.

TODO:
 - GUI
 - option to zip the data directory
 - option to strip out unneeded files/folders for a server environment
 - option to build NetRadiant
 - create a smart loop to accept multiple parameters in one line
 - option for darkplaces CPU optimization


This is an early commit of the work I've done so far on the set of bash
helper scripts I've dubbed "Nexuiz Development Toolz" which help Linux
users checkout Darkplaces, FTEQCC and Nexuiz from SVN, compile them and
optionally export two folders a "vanilla" or untouched version of Nexuiz
and a "dev" copy for the user to hack around in and learn more about the
game without worrying about breaking their "main" testing client

Future releases will cover more Nexuiz related helpers, including the
ability to compile the map making program, NetRadiant.

Thanks to Soulbringer and Victim who's scripts influenced me / helped me
create this set of functions.

Please read the comments as I've only been working on this for the past
day and a half, I haven't written much documentation outside that.

I've included icons I use when I add the application to my panel using
./ndt.sh --run_nexuiz vanilla
or
./ndt.sh --run_nexuiz dev
respectively
