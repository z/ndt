Version: 0.8 Beta
Released: 05/31/2009
Created By: Tyler "-z-" Mulligan of the Nexuiz Ninjaz (www.nexuizninjaz.com)

Required Software: subversion (svn)
For Nexuiz (ubuntu users): sudo apt-get install build-essential xserver-xorg-dev x11proto-xf86dri-dev x11proto-xf86dga-dev x11proto-xf86vidmode-dev libxxf86dga-dev libxcb-xf86dri0-dev libxpm-dev libxxf86vm-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl1.2debian-alsa subversion libclalsadrv-dev libasound2-dev libxext-dev zenity
Optional Software: 7zip

Description:
This script was created to help linux users create a local development
environment easily.  Making up for the downfalls of other build
scripts, NDT allows you to compile each part of the build process 
(engine, compiler and game) and modify their revisions seperately.

By default the script exports a vanilla copy for testing of trunk
and a development version you can hack around in.

TODO:
 - GUI
 - support relative paths in folder params
 - create a smart loop to accept multiple parameters in one line
 - option for darkplaces CPU optimization


This is a set of bash helper scripts I've dubbed "Nexuiz Development Toolz"
to help Linux users checkout Darkplaces, FTEQCC and Nexuiz from SVN,
compile them and optionally export two folders a "vanilla" or untouched
version of Nexuiz and a "dev" copy for the user to hack around in and learn
more about the game without worrying about breaking their "main" testing client

Thanks to Soulbringer and victim who's scripts influenced me / helped me
create this set of functions.

Type ./ndt --help to learn more

I've included icons I use when I add the application to my panel using
./ndt.sh --run_nexuiz vanilla
or
./ndt.sh --run_nexuiz dev
respectively
